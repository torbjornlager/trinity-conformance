# Candidate adapters

The conformance cases should share their assertions and expected outcomes.
Adapters should contain only the minimum implementation-specific mechanics
needed to launch and stop a candidate or invoke a portable local API.

The anticipated adapters are:

- `swi` — start the SWI-Prolog reference node
- `trealla` — start the native Trealla node
- `external` — test an already-running node from its base URL

Candidate configuration will eventually need at least:

- advertised profile
- HTTP base URL
- WebSocket endpoint
- startup command, when managed by the runner
- readiness probe
- authentication material, where required
- shutdown command or process handle

Wire-level cases should prefer the `external` adapter so that a new
implementation does not require changes to the conformance logic.
